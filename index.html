    <p class="info">Powerade is a popular sports drink designed to help rehydrate and refuel the body during physical activity. It typically contains a mix of electrolytes (like sodium and potassium), carbohydrates, and sometimes vitamins to replenish nutrients lost through sweat. It comes in a variety of flavors and is marketed towards athletes and active individuals to maintain hydration and energy levels. It helps support effective hydration and carbohydrates for replenishing the energy and fluids that your body loses during exercise. And it also tastes great! Vitamin B6 contributes to normal energy metabolism. </p>
